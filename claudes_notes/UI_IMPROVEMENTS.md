# UI Improvements Checklist

This document tracks user interface and user experience improvements.

## Consistency & Parity

- [x] Apply non-UI improvements to services.html (favicon, skip-link, Schema.org, ARIA labels)

## Navigation & Wayfinding

- [x] Add mobile hamburger menu for better mobile navigation UX
- [x] Add smooth scroll offset to account for sticky header when navigating to anchors
- [x] Add back-to-top button for long pages (services page)

## Interactive Elements

- [x] Enhance CTA button prominence and add subtle pulse animation to promo banner button
- [x] Improve keyboard focus visibility with custom focus ring styles
- [x] Improve service card hover effects with more engaging animations

## Polish & Performance

- [x] Add transition to page content on load for smoother entry
- [x] Add loading skeleton/placeholder for dynamically loaded header
- [x] Enhance footer with structured layout and additional useful links

## Notes

- All improvements should enhance the existing aesthetic, not change it
- Maintain the elegant, minimalist dark theme
- Focus on subtle, professional enhancements
